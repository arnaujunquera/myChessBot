# Chess Coding Challenge (C#)
This is my implementation for @SebLague's Chess Coding Challenge (see the [original repo](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)). Submissions are now closed and I'm working on this project for learning and enjoyment. The challenge involves implementing the ```think``` function declared in MyBot.cs file (located in _src/MyBot_).

The project is still a work in progress, and I plan to make improvements over the next few weeks.
