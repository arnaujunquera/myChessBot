# Chess Coding Challenge (C#)
This is my implementation for @SebLague's Chess Coding Challenge (see the [original repo](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)). Submissions are now closed and I'm just doing this to learn and have fun. The challenge consists in implementing the ```think``` function declared in MyBot.cs file (located in src/MyBot).

The project it's still in progress and I'll be improving it in the next weeks.
